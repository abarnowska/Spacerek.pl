# It is said that there is no bad weather - there are only bad clothes...

But we know that the issue is not so simple. Questions are multiplying in parents' minds.... Is the air quality OK today? Will my child be too cold? Or am I overheating them? How do I toughen up my child and what does that even mean? Is a beanie at 20 degrees Celsius a must or an exaggeration? On spacerek.pl we share our knowledge with you and provide detailed weather data for each day.
